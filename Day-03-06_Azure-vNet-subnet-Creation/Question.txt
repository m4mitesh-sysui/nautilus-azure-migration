The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their 
infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, 
they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as
a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks
into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team
to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation 
and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. 

1) Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named nautilus-vnet in the us region with any
    IPv4 CIDR block.

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategically planning the migration of a portion of their 
infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Acknowledging the magnitude of this endeavor, 
they have chosen to tackle the migration incrementally rather than as a single, 
massive transition. Their approach involves creating Virtual Networks (VNets) as the 
initial step, as they will be provisioning various services under different VNets. 

1) Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named "datacenter-vnet" in the us region with 
    192.168.0.0/24 IPv4 CIDR.

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their 
infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, 
they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a 
single massive transition. For this task, 

1) create a Virtual Network (VNet) named "datacenter-vnet" and one subnet named 
    "datacenter-subnet" within the VNet in the us region. 
2) Make sure the IPv4 address range is 10.0.0.0/16.

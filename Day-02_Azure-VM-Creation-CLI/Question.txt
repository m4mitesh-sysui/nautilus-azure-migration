The Nautilus DevOps team is in the process of migrating some of their workloads to Azure. 
One of the tasks involves creating a new Virtual Machine (VM) using the Azure CLI. 
The team does not have access to the Azure portal but can manage Azure resources via 
the azure-client host (the landing host for this lab). 

1) Create a new Azure Virtual Machine named datacenter-vm using the Azure CLI.
2) Use the Ubuntu2204 image and set the VM size to Standard_B2s.
3) Make sure the admin username is set to azureuser and SSH keys are generated for secure access. 
4) Use Standard_LRS storage account, disk size must be 30GB and ensure the VM datacenter-vm is in the running state after creation.
